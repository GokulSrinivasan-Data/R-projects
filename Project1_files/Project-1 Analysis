#Bank detail analysis:
The goal of the plot is to determine the category of people who hold the most upgraded (silver, gold and platinum) loyalty cards.
In the plot the 0 to 5 facets indicate the dependent count for the individuals. 
We can observe the trend that as the dependent count increases the upgraded loyalty card type increases.
On closer look we can determine that people who are single tend to hold the upgraded type of loyalty cards.
we can also see that single individual with 3 dependent count tend to hold the most upgraded loyalty card followed by 4,5,1 dependent count.
Single individual with 2 dependent counts and no dependent counts tend to have the same number of upgraded loyalty cards. 
So, we conclude that people in the single category tend to upgrade their loyalty card more compared to married and divorced individual.
