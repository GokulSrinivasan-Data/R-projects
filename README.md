# R-projects
List of all the projects I have created 

I use datasets available on kaggle to do my own small projects. 
The goal of these projects is to be able to get better at data 
analysis and visualization. I start with simple projects and the 
complexity increases.

To get more insights on each individual projects please look at the project analysis folder
to get an idea of what I am trying to do.
